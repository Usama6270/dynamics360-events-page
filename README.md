Featured Events Page - Dynamics 360 Internship Case Study Overview This project is a full-stack, responsive "Featured Events" webpage developed for the Dynamics 360 Web Development Internship Case Study. It features a modern, mobile-friendly UI with a MongoDB backend for dynamic event management, simulated JWT-based registration, and advanced filtering capabilities. Technologies Used Frontend

React 18.3.1: Component-based UI. React-Bootstrap 5.3.3: Responsive styling. Axios: API requests. CSS3: Custom styling (hover effects, gradients).

Backend

Node.js & Express: Robust API server. MongoDB (Atlas): Event data storage. Mongoose: Schema modeling. JSON Web Token (JWT): Simulated user registration. CORS & Dotenv: Secure API communication.

Deployment

Backend: Vercel (https://dynamics360-events-page-l9d7.vercel.app) Frontend: Netlify (https://usama-jamshed-app.netlify.app) GitHub: https://github.com/Usama6270/dynamics360-events-page

Features

Responsive Navigation Bar: Features links to "Home," "Events," and "Contact" with a mobile-friendly hamburger menu. Hero Section: Displays "Discover Events Near You" with a gradient background.
